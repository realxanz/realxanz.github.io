**Difficulties**

In this project, Iâ€™ve faced problems with generating the enemies, that makes the game stutter a little, and also had problems with the camera.

**How I solved It**

To fix the enemy generation problem, I've used a coroutine with a random number that made the generation spaced and not all together and with that, the game didn't stutter. And camera problems were fixed by learning how to use the cinemachine asset.
