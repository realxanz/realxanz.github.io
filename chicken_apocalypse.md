## Chicken Apocalypse

**Project description:** A 3rd person shooter where you play as a chicken who shoots the enemy snakes. 
This project was made for a college assignment.

**In this project I acted as:**
game designer and developer, and I was the only programmer in this project, making this a great learning project for me.

**Difficulties:**
In this project, Iâ€™ve faced problems with generating the enemies, that makes the game stutter a little, and also had problems with the camera.

**How I solved It:**
To fix the enemy generation problem, I've used a coroutine with a random number that made the generation spaced and not all together and with that, the game didn't stutter.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
