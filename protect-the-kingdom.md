**Difficulties**

In this project, we didn't face many difficulties in the development because we already created a TD game in construct 3. The major problems were balance and game difficulty.

**How We solved It**

To fix this we created a lot of development builds for people to test, after a lot of testing, we were able to create a way more balanced game.
