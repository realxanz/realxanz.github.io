I’ve worked as a game designer and visual scripting (Construct 3) developer for this project. I designed core gameplay with Rodrigo Praetzel.

**Difficulties**

In this project, I’ve faced problems where the core gameplay was too clunky and the enemies were dying by jumping on their side and not their “head”.

**How I solved It**

To fix this we tested a lot, changed the jump height and speed, after that we fixed the monster dying problem.
